# Troubleshooting

## Ignoring optional dependencies

When running `npm install`, you can get warnings about optionsl dependencies:

```
npm WARN optional Skipping failed optional dependency /chokidar/fsevents:
npm WARN notsup Not compatible with your operating system or architecture: fsevents@1.2.7
```

You can suppress them by adding the `no-optional` switch:

```
npm install --no-optional
```

## Resolving dependencies

When installing for the first time, you can get warnings which need to be resolved:

```
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of babel-eslint@^8.0.1 but none was installed.
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of eslint@^4.0 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-intl-redux@^0.7 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-responsive@^4 but none was installed.
```

You can check which versions are available:

```
npm view react-intl-redux@0.* version
```

You will neet do install the required version:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
```

The dependency itself might have more missing dependencies, which will show up like this:

```
user@machine:~/sources/scratch/scratch-gui (491-translatable-library-objects)$ npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
scratch-gui@0.1.0 /media/cuideigin/Linux/sources/scratch/scratch-gui
├── react-intl-redux@0.7.0
└── UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-responsive@5.0.0
```

You will need to install those as well:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-responsive@^5.0.0
```
